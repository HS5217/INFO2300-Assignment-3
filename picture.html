      <h2>Characters</h2>
    <img src="./Pictures/Chris.jpg" alt="" height="100" width="100">
    <h2>Chris Redfield</h2>
     <p>One of the protagonists of the game. Chris is much stronger and faster than Jill, making him more resistant to enemy attacks and have more possibilities to avoid them. But to compensate for this strength, his scenario is made more challenging</p>
    <img src="./Pictures/Jill.jpg" alt="" height="100" width="100">
    <h2>Jill Valentine</h2>
     <p> One of the protagonists of the game. Jill's scenario is the simpler of the two, as she has a higher carrying capacity (eight items simultaneously, as opposed to Chris' six) and has a lockpick that serves as a substitute for the small keys in Chris' scenario (as well as the Sword Key in the original game).</p>
    <img src="./Pictures/Barry.jpg" alt="" height="100" width="100" >
    <h2>Barry Burton</h2>
    <p>A S.T.A.R.S. member who assists Jill in her search. Barry is blackmailed into murder and the destruction of evidence by the traitorous S.T.A.R.S. leader, Albert Wesker. Barry has make to choice between to obey Wesker orders or disgrade them and saves his fellow S.T.A.R.S members lives and his family pays the price</p>
    <img src="./Pictures/Rebecca.jpg" alt="" height="100" width="100">
    <h2>Rebecca Chambers</h2>
    <p> A S.T.A.R.S. member who assists Chris in his search. Rebecca is one of the survivors of the incident, whose disappearance prompted Alpha team's investigation, and is currently the only one alive from the Bravo team. </p>
    <img src="./Pictures/Wesker.jpg" alt="" height="100" width="100">
    <h2>Albert Wesker</h2>
     <p> Leader of Alpha team and S.T.A.R.S., Wesker was also an undercover spy of Umbrella and plans to dispose of his former teammates and gather data on the Bio-Organic Weapons.</p>
    <img src="./Pictures/STARS alpha and bravo team.jpg" alt="" height="100" width="100">
    <h2>STARS Alpha and Bravo Team</h2>
    <p>Two teams in the S.T.A.R.S unit:</p>

        <h2>Creatures</h2>
       <img src="./Pictures/Zombie (2).jpg" alt="" height="100" width="100">
        <h2>Zombie</h2>
      <p>A zombie refers to any person who has been infected with the T-Virus and turned into a reanimated corpse. Modeled after the classic Romero zombie, these enemies seek human flesh. They're fairly slow, so you can dodge them most of the time. They don't pose much of a threat, and many can be easily taken out with some Beretta shots or a single Shotgun blast to the head (however, in the game's progression, the zombies' health range and endurance levels increase, so you'll have to simply try to evade them by staying to one side, distracting them, and quickly move to the next). Some may pretend to be dead on the ground, so watch out (you'll know when they're dead when they begin to bleed). Don't Underestimate them</p>
       <img src="./Pictures/Cerberus.jpg" alt="" height="100" width="100">
       <h2>Cerberus</h2>
         <p>a  Cerberus was used as a subject by Umbrella to test the effects of the T-Virus. They were given the code number MA-39 and were named Cerberus after the mythological three-headed guardian of Hades. They're very fast but weak, and can be taken down in a couple of Beretta shots or a Shotgun blast. After getting shot once, they'll cower and start to charge again. You can use this time to shoot them again from a safe distance. </p>
       <img src="./Pictures/Crows.jpg" alt="" height="100" width="100">
       <h2>Crows</h2>
       <p>An infected crow is larger than a regular crow and will immediately attack any living creature that wanders into its territory. It's very weak and can be totally avoided, so don't even bother shooting at one (they can be taken down in one shot by any weapon). It's also very sensitive to noise, so shooting near or running past one will immediately make it agitated.
      </p>
       <img src="./Pictures/Hunters.jpg" alt="" height="100" width="100">
       <h2>Hunters</h2>
        <p>Hunters are bipedal reptilian-like creatures with large claws and teeth, and are noted for the loud shrieking noises they make when they encounter and pursue prey.They are fast and have powerful attacks, and can take a good amount of firepower to take down. If encountered, they should immediately be taken out, as they pose a very large threat. If you are in danger mode and near a hunter, it will immediately try to decapitate you, so heal yourself before trying to take one on. The best weapon to use is the Colt Python, as it can them out in one shot (two shots in the Original English version). </p>
       <img src="./Pictures/Tyrant.jpg" alt="" height="100" width="100">
       <h2>Tyrant</h2>
        <p>Umbrella's ultimate bio-weapon, the Tyrant (T-002 model) is one of Umbrella's first attempts at creating a super soldier. A Tyrant subject was once a human who was injected with the T-Virus, and because of an extremely rare DNA occurrence, the human subject became a Tyrant (any human without this special kind of DNA would just become a zombie). This model comes with an extremely large claw, and is very fast and deadly. For the first encounter, simply stand far away and start shooting with the Colt Python. For the second encounter, you'll have to try to dodge Tyrant's claw swipes by running to his right (since his claw is on his left hand).</p>
       <img src="./Pictures/ps1 tyrant.jpg" alt="" height="100" width="100">
       <h2>Tyrant Boss PS1</h2>
       <p> When you have dealt enough damage to him, or when the explosion is a few seconds away, Brad will throw the Rocket Launcher at you. A single hit with this weapon will kill him instantly.</p>
